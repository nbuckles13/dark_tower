# The Dark Tower

The Dark Tower is a book series by Stephen King whose name we will co-op as the code name for a video conferencing project.  This project has ambitious goals of using AI code tools to fully develop, deploy, and operate a modern, feature-rich, customizable, and highly scalable video conferencing platform.  The initial version will have the following main components:

1. Global Controller -- This entity will run in multiple datacenters around the world using a single well known URL that is mapped via DNS to the nearest datacenter.  This is the API entry point for most users to join a video conference.
2. Meeting Controller -- This entity will run individual meetings; managing the signaling required to join the meeting, take actions within the meeting, negotiate which types and formats of media are being sent.  Within a given region, a single meeting controller is associated with any individual meeting.  Across regions, multiple meeting controllers may cooperate to manage the same meeting but this is not required.
3. Media Handler -- This entity sends and receives media between itself and clients, as well as itself and other instances of itself.  This entity is instructed by the meeting controller which media to send where.  This entity can not only forward media between clients, but it can manipulate this media (transcoding, mixing, etc).  This entity supports multiple methods for reception and transmission of media.
4. Client -- This entity is the user facing application.  The user will interact with this application to join online meetings, take actions within those meetings, and exchange media with other users.  This entity will initially be a web application leveraging the WebCodec and WebTransport technologies for the required signaling and media functions.

# Overarching Goals
## Development Goals

- All of the code written for this project is AI generated
- All of the unit, component, integration, and other tests are AI generated
- All of the metrics, dashboards, alarms, and run-books are AI generated
- All of the deploys, secrets management, and security best practices are AI generated
- All of the documentation is AI generated
- High density deployments with excellent vertical and horizontal scaling at all levels
- Open source project that anyone can take and run themselves
- Open APIs that can be extended and leveraged for other use cases

## User Facing Goals

- A simple to use, robust video conferencing application
- Break rules that unnecessarily hamstring and limit users (e.g. one content share at a time, only one camera)
- Tons of nerd knobs that are hidden but easily accessible to power users
