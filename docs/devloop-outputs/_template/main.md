# Devloop Output: {Task Title}

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Task**: Brief description of what was implemented
**Specialist**: {specialist-name}
**Mode**: Agent Teams (v2)
**Branch**: `branch-name`
**Duration**: ~Xm (approximate total time)

## Loop Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Start Commit | `{git rev-parse HEAD at setup}` |
| Branch | `{current branch}` |

---

## Loop State (Internal)

<!-- This section is maintained by the Lead for state recovery after interruption. -->
<!-- Do not edit manually - the Lead updates this as the loop progresses. -->

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | `{setup|planning|implementation|review|complete}` |
| Implementer | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| Implementing Specialist | `{specialist-name}` |
| Iteration | `{1-5}` |
| Security | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| Test | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| Observability | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| Code Quality | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| DRY | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| Operations | `{agent_id or pending}` |
| Semantic Guard | `{agent_id or pending}` |

<!-- LEAD REMINDER:
     - Update this table at EVERY phase transition
     - Capture teammate IDs AS SOON as you spawn them
     - When phase is review and all reviewers approve, advance to complete and proceed to Step 8 (Commit)
     - Only mark complete after Gate 3 approval
     - Use /devloop-status to check state
     - If interrupted, restart the devloop; main.md records start commit for rollback
-->

## Task Overview

## Cross-Boundary Classification

<!-- List EVERY planned file change. For each, classify per ADR-0024 §6.2:
     - Mine — in the implementing specialist's domain (trivial, the common case)
     - Not mine, Mechanical — cross-boundary, sed-test clean, guard-pipeline covered
     - Not mine, Minor-judgment — cross-boundary, bounded impact; owner must review & confirm at Gate 1 + Gate 3
     - Not mine, Domain-judgment — needs owner-implements or --paired-with=<owner>

     For Guarded Shared Area paths (ADR-0024 §6.4), Mechanical is disallowed; Owner must be filled.
     Fill Owner (if not mine) for cross-boundary rows.

     Path column convention: backtick-quoted paths. Globs (`*`, `?`, `[]`,
     trailing `/`, `/**`) and parenthetical annotations like `foo.rs` (regen)
     are tolerated by the `validate-cross-boundary-scope` parser at
     scripts/guards/common.sh, and are recommended where they clarify intent
     — use `dir/**` (or `dir/`, which the parser canonicalizes to
     `dir/**`) to scope a whole tree, `*.svelte` for a filename glob,
     and `(regen)` / `(cleanup)` /
     `(skeleton-only)` suffixes for per-row context. Prefer the simplest
     form that is accurate: if a literal path conveys the same information,
     use that; reach for a glob when enumerating every file would be noise,
     and reach for a parenthetical when the row's nature (regen, cleanup,
     new-vs-modify) materially changes how a reviewer reads it. Longer-form
     file-shape context (rationale, scope qualifiers, "why this shape") still
     belongs in § Implementation Summary or § Files Modified — the table
     answers one question per row: whose domain is this, and how stringent
     is the involvement. -->

| Path | Classification | Owner (if not mine) |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| `{path}` | Mine \| Not mine, Mechanical \| Not mine, Minor-judgment \| Not mine, Domain-judgment | {specialist or —} |

## Tech Debt Pointers

**Tech debt entries themselves live in `docs/TODO.md`. This section holds only pointers to those entries.** Do not create a `TODO.md` at the repo root or anywhere else — there is exactly one `docs/TODO.md` for the whole project. Do not inline the debt body here — multi-line entries belong in `docs/TODO.md`, not in this section.

Each pointer is exactly one bullet of the form `- \`docs/TODO.md\` §SECTION-NAME — one-line hook (≤80 chars)`. If you wrote more than one line per entry, you're writing it in the wrong file — move the body to `docs/TODO.md` and leave only the pointer here.

Examples:

```
- `docs/TODO.md` §Observability Debt — orphan recording-site audit follow-up
- `docs/TODO.md` §Cross-Service Duplication (DRY) — extract record_token_refresh_metrics
```

or:

```
- (none surfaced in this devloop)
```

## Rollback Procedure

If this devloop needs to be reverted:
1. Verify start commit from Loop Metadata: `{start_commit}`
2. Review all changes: `git diff {start_commit}..HEAD`
3. Soft reset (preserves changes): `git reset --soft {start_commit}`
4. Hard reset (clean revert): `git reset --hard {start_commit}`
5. For schema changes: rollback requires a forward migration — `git reset` alone is insufficient if migrations were applied
6. For infrastructure changes: may require `skaffold delete` or `kubectl delete -f` if manifests were applied
