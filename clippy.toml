# Allow expect(), unwrap(), and indexing in test code
# Per ADR-0002, these are prohibited in production code but acceptable in tests
#
# Note: These options only work for code in #[cfg(test)] modules and #[test] functions.
# Integration tests (tests/ directory) and test helper functions need crate-level overrides.
# See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/13981
